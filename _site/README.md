FIXES NEEDED
-- make sure the mobile (small window) experience is good
  1. when there are lots of columns, it should stack
  2. the filter section in latest-post should be retractable

-- map doesn't work on Github Pages but works locally..
  - when it was https it didn't authenticate but when it is http it just doesn't load

FEATURES NEEDED
-- the post layout needs to be updated
  - should have page-header (maybe look different)
  - a back button
  - previous and next button

-- Google Forms --> Google Script --> Github !!!
