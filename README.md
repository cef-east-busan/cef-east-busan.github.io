FIXES NEEDED
-- make sure the mobile (small window) experience is good
  1. home page
    - when there are lots of columns, it should stack
  2. latest post
    - the filter section in latest-post should be retractable
    - the category should be put under the title so it's not verticle
    - maybe the date format can change?

-- map doesn't work on Github Pages but works locally..
  - when it was https it didn't authenticate but when it is http it just doesn't load

FEATURES NEEDED
-- the post layout needs to be updated
  - should have page-header (maybe look different)
  - a back button
  - previous and next button

-- Google Forms --> Google Script --> Github !!!
  - needs to take links, pictures, files, videos

-- 최신글 should stick out a bit? red blob background?

MAYBE ADD
-- 조회수 Views, Google Analytics...

WOULD BE NICE
-- create account and comment, interactive --> foster sense of community

more stuff
- default gallery thumbnail (not necessary ig)
